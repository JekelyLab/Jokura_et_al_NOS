## Abstract

Nitric oxide (NO) generated by nitric-oxide synthase (NOS) is a key regulator of animal physiology. Here we uncover a role for NO in shaping circuit dynamics to orchestrate light-avoidance behaviour. We studied UV-avoidance mediated by brain ciliary photoreceptors (cPRCs) in larval *Platynereis dumerilii*, a marine annelid. We found NOS specifically expressed in interneurons (INNOS) postsynaptic to cPRCs. Stimulation of cPRCs by violet light leads to cPRC inhibition but concomitant INNOS activation and NO production. NO feeds back to cPRCs and triggers their delayed activation through an unconventional guanylyl cyclase. This results in the activation of projection interneurons and the inhibition of serotonergic ciliomotor neurons. In *NOS* mutants, NO feedback and projection-neuron activation do not occur and avoidance behaviour is defective. By mathematical modelling, we could capture the circuit dynamics in both wild-type and mutant larvae. Our results reveal how NO-mediated neuroendocrine signalling gates a synaptic circuit to initiate light-avoidance behaviour.

## Introduction

The ability to perceive changes in the environment and adapt behaviour accordingly is essential for the survival of all living organisms. Avoidance from UV radiation, which damages DNA essential for survival, is proposed to be one of the behaviours that existed before the abundant development of Earth's oxygen to block UV radiation in the atmosphere (Pittendrigh). In the ocean, almost all zooplankton have a pronounced rhythmic behaviour called Diel vertical migration (DVM), which consists of upwards towards the surface at dusk and descend back to deeper water before dawn. Avoidance behaviour to escape harmful UV radiation during the day is closely linked to the control of vertical migration in the ocean. However, little is known about the molecular neural circuit mechanisms in UV avoidance behaviour in many animals, including zooplankton. In neural circuits in general light response, the activation of various receptors by excitatory and inhibitory neurotransmitters such as glutamate, GABA and dopamine is known in various species. In addition to this, it has long been known that in nitric oxide (NO), as a neuromodulatory molecule, it is also important as a modulator of visual activity. NO is a small free-radical molecule with diffusible and changeable characteristics, and thus works as one of the neural signalling molecules. The function of NO in the neural circuitry of vision has been well studied in vertebrates. In the mammalian retina, NO is an essential signalling molecule in all retinal cells. NO produced by nitric oxide synthase (NOS) in amacrine cells, one of the retinal cells, activates soluble guanylate cyclase (sGC) expressed in cone bipolar cells, which produces cGMP and regulates downstream signalling. We therefore hypothesise that NO-mediated neural signalling may be involved in the photoreceptor circuits that control UV avoidance behaviour. To test this hypothesis we used the annelid *Platynereis dumerilii*, which conserved vertebrate-type ciliary photoreceptors (cPRCs) [@Arendt2004]. The cPRC expresses c-opsin1, which absorbs UV radiation, is involved in melatonin production and regulates circadian swimming behaviour [@Tosches2014; @tsukamoto2017]. Furthermore, we previously reported abnormal UV avoidance behaviour in c-opsin1 knockout larvae [@Veraszto2018]. The cPRCs express the UV-absorbing c-opsin1 and mediate UV avoidance in the larvae [@Veraszto2018]. In adult worms, UV light and c-opsin1 modulate locomotion and maturation [@Veedin2021]. These suggest that Platynereis larvae are a highly suitable model for elucidating the neural circuit mechanisms of NO-induced UV avoidance behaviour, and the accessibility of genome editing, behavioural assays, calcium imaging and whole-body connectomics could be very useful for study at the molecular level[@ozpolat2021].

## Results

**Nitric oxide synthase is expressed in interneurons of the UV-avoidance circuit**

We identified a single *nitric oxide synthase* (*NOS*) gene in the *Platynereis dumerilii* genome and transcriptome data. Phylogenetic analysis of NOS proteins indicate that *Platynereis* NOS belongs to an orthology group of metazoan NOS sequences (Figure 1---figure supplement 1). To characterise the expression pattern of *NOS* we used in situ hybridization chain reaction (HCR) and transient transgenesis. In two- and three-day-old larvae, we detected *NOS* expression in four cells (two of them weakly expressing) in the apical organ region (Figure 1A-D). The same four cells were labelled with a reporter construct driving palmitoylated-tdTomato by a 12 kbp upstream genomic region of the *NOS* gene (Figure 1E). This reporter also revealed the axonal projections of the NOS-expressing neurons. The position and morphology of the four *NOS*-expressing cells allowed us to identify the same cells in the three-day-old whole-body volume EM data [@williams2017; @veraszto2020] as four interneurons (INNOS)(Figure 1F and G). The INNOS cells are postsynaptic to the UV-sensory cPRCs and presynaptic to the INRGW interneurons, which are also cPRC targets (Figure 1C, D). INRGW neurons synapse on the head serotonergic ciliomotor neurons (Ser-h1), which synapse on the prototroch ciliary band and the cholinergic MC ciliomotor neurons (Figure 1C, D). We also detected *NOS* expression by HCR in the region of the visual eyes and the pigmented eyespots.

**Nitric oxide signalling mediates UV-avoidance behaviour**

The specific expression of NOS in interneurons directly postsynaptic to the cPRCs suggests that NO signalling is involved in the UV response. To test this, we generated two *Platynereis* *NOS* knockout lines with the CRISPR/Cas9 method. We recovered two deletions (NOSΔ11/Δ11 and Δ23/Δ23), both leading to an early stop codon and thus likely representing null alleles (Figure 2A). We could establish a homozygous line for both mutations indicating that NOS is not an essential gene. To quantify UV avoidance, we recorded the trajectories of freely swimming larvae in vertical columns, illuminated laterally from two opposite sides with 395 nm violet light. We also tested phototaxis, by exposing larvae to 480 nm directional and collimated light from the top of the column. As previously shown, wild-type larvae swim downward within 30 sec following non-directional UV/violet light stimulation [@veraszto2018]. In contrast, homozygous *NOS*-mutant larvae showed a strongly diminished UV-avoidance response (Figure 2B and C). This phenotype is similar to the defective UV-avoidance of *c-opsin1* mutant larvae and reveals a requirement for NOS in UV-avoidance behaviour [@veraszto2018]. *NOS*-mutant larvae also showed reduced phototactic behaviour, suggesting a function in the visual eyes mediating phototaxis [@Randel2014a], where *NOS* is also expressed (Figure 1). To test if the observed defects are due to a role of NOS in neuronal signalling or circuit developmental, we also tested larvae exposed to a NOS inhibitor, L-NAME. Larvae incubated for xy min in 0.1 mM or 1 mM L-NAME showed defective UV avoidance, but normal phototaxis. Overall, our results indicate an acute requirement for NOS signalling in UV-avoidance and a possible indirect, developmental role in the visual system.

To analyse the behaviour of larvae before and after UV stimulation in more detail, the temporal changes in some parameters were compared using tracking of individual larvae of the WT and mutant (Figure 2D). The results showed that in the WT there was a rapid and strong increase in downward swimming approximately 15 s after UV stimulation, whereas this did not occur in the mutant (Figure 2E). Interestingly, there was already a difference in swimming speed between the WT and the mutant before UV stimulation (in the dark) (Figure 2F). After UV stimulation, the swimming speed of the WT increased and reached a maximum after about 15 s. In contrast, the swimming speed of the mutant did not increase after about 15 s. In contrast, the mutants showed a slight increase in speed after UV stimulation, but swimming speed was not maintained and returned to the speed before UV stimulation. To investigate the role of NO on UV avoidance behaviour, receptors for NO were explored.

**Nitric oxide produced during UV/violet stimulation gates the output of the cPRC circuit**

To test if NO is produced during UV/violet responses, we injected zygotes with the fluorescent NO-reporter DAF-FM and imaged two-day-old larvae during the local stimulation of the cPRC cilia by 405 nm light (Figure 4---figure supplement 1). Following light stimulation, we detected an increase in DAF-FM fluorescence in the region of the INNOS cells (Figure 4A). We next analysed the dynamics of the cPRC circuit following light stimulation. As we have shown previously [@Veraszto2018], a 20-sec illumination of the cPRC ciliary region lead to a decrease in cPRC calcium levels, likely due to the hyperpolarisation of the cPRCs. After 20-sec, calcium levels in cPRCs were raising again, reaching higher levels than at the start of the stimulus - a response that may involve depolarisation. This activation phase occurs after the end of the stimulation and may be due to a slower neuroendocrine feedback [@Veraszto2018]. To determine whether NO mediates such a feedback, we measured calcium signals in *NOS*-mutant larvae. While we detected the inhibition phase in cPRC in *NOS*-mutants, this was not followed by activation and calcium levels remained low (Figure 4B and C). These results revealed an essential requirement for NOS signalling in the second phase of the cPRC response.

**Two unconventional guanylyl cyclases (NIT-GC) are expressed in the cPRCs**

NO generally acts via soluble guanylate cyclases (sGC), belonging to the guanylate cyclase family with a CYC domain (PF00211). NO binding to the heme group of sGC leads to increased cyclic guanosine monophosphate (cGMP) production. Analysis of sGCs in *Platynereis* indicated that these genes are not expressed in any of the cells of the cPRC circuit ([@Veraszto2017] and data not shown). Recently, Moroz and coworkers reported an atypical but widely conserved family of guanylyl cyclases with a NIT (nitrite/nitrate sensing) domain (PF08376) (NIT-GC) as potential mediators of NO signalling [@Moroz2020]. To search for NIT-GCs in _Platynereis_, we searched transcriptome resources and retrieved 15 potential NIT-GC homologs. To analyse the relationship of these sequences to metazoan NIT-GCs, we retrieved protein sequences with a CYC domain from the transcriptome and genome databases of 45 metazoan species and [**how many?] choanoflagellate. We carried out cluster analysis and did phylogenetic reconstruction on a group of membrane-bound guanylyl cyclases with sGCs as an outgroup. In agreement with Moroz et al. [@Moroz2020],we found a group of GCs with NIT domains with representatives in placozoans, cnidarians, some ecdysozoans, echinoderms, and lophotrochozoans. The 15 _Platynereis_ sequences were parts of several major and ancient clades of the tree (Figure 4---figure supplement 1). 
To characterise the expression of NIT-GCs, we using previously published spatially mapped single-cell transcriptome data [@Achim2015; @williams2017]. Among the 15 NIT-GCs, four showed high and specific expression in the cPRCs and one was expressed in the INNOS cells (Figure 3---figure supplement 1). In the single-cell data, we could identify the cPRCs by the specific expression of c-opsin1 and a pedal-peptide2 neuropeptide precursor (MLD proneuropeptide) [@Arendt2004; @williams2017], which have previously been described as cPRC markers (Figure 3A and B, Figure 3---figure supplement 2). The INNOS cells were identified by NOS expression and their spatial mapping. 
We decided to focus on two NIT-GCs expressed in the cPRCs and with a full-length sequences, NIT-GC1 and NIT-GC2. To confirm the single-cell data, we first carried out HCR with probes for _NIT-GC1_ and _NIT-GC2_ mRNA. Both genes showed very clear and specific expression in the four cPRCs, as confirmed by co-labeling with an acetylated tubulin antibody and with an HCR probe against _MLD proneuropeptide_. To analyse the subcellular localisation of NIT-GC1 and NIT-GC2 at the protein level, we raised and affinity-purified polyclonal antibodies against a specific peptide sequence from both proteins. In immunostainings, we found that NIT-GC1 was localise to the region corresponding to the axonal projections of the cPRCs in the anterior nerve plexus. Co-immunostaining with the rabbit NIT-GC1 and the rat NOS antibodies revealed that both proteins were localised in close proximity in the neurosecretory plexus (Figure 3---figure supplement 3). In contrast, NIT-GC2 strongly and specifically labelled the large sensory ciliary region of the cPRCs (Figure 3C and D). These different subcellular localisations suggest that the two NIT-GCs are involved in different intracellular signalling processes in the ciliary and axonal regions of the cPRCs.

**NIT-GC1 is required for the depolarising response of cPRC to UV stimulation**

To characterise the role of NIT-GCs within the cPRC during UV stimulation in more detail, the calcium sensor GCaMP6s were ubiquitously expressed in larvae in which NIT-GCs were knocked down using morpholino to examine changes in calcium levels in the cPRC. Local stimulation of the ciliated part of the cPRC with 405 nm light causes a transient decrease in calcium levels in the cPRC (hyperpolarisation), followed by an increase in calcium levels (depolarisation) when the light is switched off [@veraszto2018]. In NIT-GC1 morphant larvae, 405 nm light stimulation caused a decrease in calcium levels in the cPRC, but the increase in calcium levels that occurred after the light stimulation was stopped was strongly suppressed (Figure 3E). This result suggests that NIT-GC1 mediates depolarising responses after UV stimulation of cPRC and may be involved in extracellular signalling. Interestingly, in NIT-GC2 morphant larvae, an increase in calcium levels occurred immediately after light stimulation (Figure 3F). The different responses of cPRC upon knockdown of NIT-GC1 and NIT-GC2 suggest that there may be different intracellular signalling mechanisms associated with their respective localisations. We focused our analysis on NIT-GC1 because it was localised to cPRC neuroaxons within the neuroplexas region and is involved in extracellular signalling after UV stimulation. It is generally known that depolarisation in the PRC involves elevated cGMPs in the photoreceptors. We therefore used an in vitro system in which cultured cells expressed NIT-GC1 to assess the cGMP activity of NIT-GC1.

**NIT-GC1 produces cGMP by nitric oxide**

NIT-GC1 has a highly conserved cyclase domain and activation of NIT-GC1 is expected to produce cGMP. Recently, a synthetic protein called Green cGull was developed as a cGMP indicator that can be used in cultured cell systems [@Matsuda2017]. We co-expressed Green cGull and NIT-GC1 using the 2A self-cleaving peptide in cultured cells COS-7 (monkey kidney) and tested the intracellular dynamics of cGMP in the activation of NIT-GC1 (Figure 3---figure supplement 4). When the NO donor SNAP was applied to the NIT-GC1 and Green cGull co-expression cells, the intracellular cGMP levels was significantly increased compared to when NIT-GC1 was not expressed (Figure 3G and H). The increase in fluorescence intensity also did not occur when DMSO was applied (Figure 3I). To confirm whether this increase in intracellular cGMP levels is NIT domain-dependent response of NIT-GC1, mutant form of NIT-GC1 without the NIT domain was expressed and SNAP was applied (Figure 3---figure supplement 4A). As a result, the increase in fluorescence intensity was significantly reduced (Figure 3J). These results indicate that NIT-GC1 produces cGMP via the NIT domain. In bacteria, it has been proposed that the NIT domain regulates cellular functions in response to changes in extracellular and intracellular nitrate and nitrite concentrations. Our results suggest that NIT-GC1 may be sensitive to NO. This could be a possible feedback pathway in which NIT-GC1 expressed in cPRC is activated by NO produced by IN-NOS. In order to further explore the role of NO in the cPRC circuit, we therefore compared calcium imaging of postsynaptic cells (IN-NOS, IN-RGW, Ser-h1, MC) in the cPRC circuit during UV stimulation of cPRC between WT and NOS mutant larvae.

We next quantified the responses of the INNOS and INRGW interneurons following a UV/violet stimulus to the cPRCs. To unambiguously identify the cells from which we recorded calcium signals, we developed an on-slide immunostaining method. We used the cell-specific neuropeptide markers anti-RYamide (INNOS) and anti-RGWa (INRGW) [@Conzelmann2011] to mark the interneurons. Based on the position of the nuclei, we could correlate live and fixed samples at a single-cell precision (Figure 4---figure supplement 2). In both wild type and *NOS*-mutant larvae, INNOS cells showed increase calcium signals during the inhibition phase of the cPRCs (Figure 4D and E). In addition, In-NOS depolarisation was suppressed in NIT-GC2 molphants where cPRC hyperpolarisation was suppressed. This indicates that cPRC hyperpolarisation is required for IN-NOS depolarisation (Figure 4F). In contrast, calcium signals increased in INRGW cells in wild-type larvae during the second activation phase of cPRCs, a response that was lacking in *NOS*-mutants (Figure 4G and H). This suggests that there is no circuit output to the Ser-h1 cells and the ciliary band in *NOS*-mutants, consistent with the observed behavioural defects(Figure 4I).

## Discussion

In the present study, we explored the role of NO in the UV avoidance behaviour of Platynereis. We demonstrated that there are interneurons expressing NOS in the cPRC circuit and that NO is required for UV avoidance in behavioural experiments using NOS mutants. We identified the axon-localised type NIT-GC1 and the cilia-localised type NIT-GC2 expressed in the cPRCs as targets of NO and showed from cultured cell experiments that these produce cGMP in response to NO. We have shown by calcium imaging that INNOSs are activated in response to the hyperpolarising response of the cPRCs, that the NO produced feeds back to the cPRC via NIT-GC1 and induces a depolarising response in the cPRC, and that the depolarising response of the cPRC is involved in activating downstream INRGW. Lastly, we confirmed that RGWamide induces the downward swimming behaviour of larvae.

cPRCs expressing UV-absorbing c-opsin1 have high resting calcium levels and show hyperpolarising and subsequent depolarising responses to UV light (405 nm) [@Veraszto2018]. In the present study, we have shown that the cells that strongly synapse with cPRCs are interneurons that specifically express NOS (INNOS). The fluorescence intensity of DAF-FM, which specifically detected INNOS, showed a transient tonic-like increase dependent on UV stimulation of the cPRCs. The graph shows a decrease in intensity after UV light is switched off, but the response of DAF-FM to NO is irreversible and this decrease is due to breaching by the relatively strong excitation light. Attempts to measure changes in the intensity of the calcium indicator RGECO1a simultaneously with DAF-FM imaging did not lead to detection of changes in fluorescence intensity compared to GCaMP6s and could only visualise the cPRCs. In calcium imaging using GCaMP6s, INNOS identified by the positional relationship between the cPRC and INNOS and the labelling of RYa depolarised in clear synchrony with the hyperpolarising response of the cPRCs. This tonic response may involve dopaminergic nerves based on single-cell data (Fig) [@puopolo2001][@zhang2007][@Randel2014a]. In the mammalian retina, it is known that signals from bipolar photoreceptor cells are transmitted to downstream NOS-expressing amacrine cells (NOAC), where NO is produced [@jacoby2018]. These suggest that UV stimulation of cPRCs causes the production of NO via a depolarising response of INNOS.

Our results suggest that NIT-GC1, which is specifically expressed in cPRCs, functions as a target for NO produced by INNOS and contributes to the regulation of the cPRC circuit transmission pathway via a depolarising response by increasing cGMP. In the mammalian retina, NO is an essential signalling molecule and one of the most well-studied [@Cudeiro1999]. It has been reported that NO produced in one of the retinal cells modulates cGMP-mediated neurotransmission by activating presynaptic neural sGCs (general target of NO) through retrograde signalling [@Vielma2014][@Wei2012]. In Platynereis cPRC, NIT-GC1 was also identified as having the property of producing cGMP in a NO-dependent manner. Furthermore, it is known that CNGAα, one of the cyclic nucleotide-gated channels, is specifically highly expressed in cPRC [@Tosches2014], and in INNOS-cPRC signalling, NO is implicated in the neuromodulation of the cPRC by retrograde signalling. NO is a molecule with a very short half-life, and when functioning as a signalling molecule, NOS and sGC are known to localise very close together at synapses between neurons [@burette2002][@garthwaite2015a]. In our study, we found 12 sGCs in Platynereis, but none expressed in the cPRC. Localisation analysis of NOS and NIT-GC1 by antibody staining showed that the two proteins localised very close together in the anterior neurosecretory plexus region. Calcium imaging results using NOS mutant and NIT-GC1 knockdown larvae suggest that NIT-GC1 activation induces a depolarising response in the cPRC.

Another type of interneuron that strongly synapses with the cPRC is the INRGWa, which synapses directly onto the ciliomotor neuron and is therefore considered to be a very important neuron in the control of larval behaviour [@Veraszto2018][@williams2017]. The present results suggest that the depolarising response of the cPRC due to NO feedback induces INRGW activation. RGWamide is also a neuropeptide that induces larval downward swimming quite strongly (unpublished? need to show data?), and the delayed downward swimming of NOS mutant larvae in response to UV stimulation may be responsible for the failure of INRGW activation to occur. In addition, in many marine invertebrates, NO has been reported to be involved in many aspects of settlement behaviour and metamorphosis induction [@leise2001; @bishop2003; @bishop2007; @pechenik2007; @castellano2014; @ueda2013; @ueda2014; @ueda2016; @yang2018; @zhu2020; @song2021]. The downward swimming behaviour of Platynereis larvae is the first step in the onset of settlement behaviour and metamorphosis. These suggest that downward swimming due to NO activation of INRGWs may trigger the onset of settlement behaviour and metamorphosis [@Conzelmann2013][@Williams2015]. These suggest that NO feedback signalling may act as a trigger for downward swimming via activation of INRGWs, which induces the initiation of settlement behaviour and metamorphosis.

An outstanding question is how the NO\~NIT-GC response alters neuronal dynamics. NO is a single molecule and, due to its short half-life, cannot be transmitted over long distances and has a limited signalling repertoire. It has therefore been considered unsuitable for generating diversity in signalling compared to other signalling molecules such as neuropeptides and classical neurotransmitters [@Jékely2021]. However, our results in the present study indicate that NO-induced activation of NIT-GC1 is involved in the regulation of neuronal circuits (cPRC pathway). The NIT domain was originally found in bacteria and the existence of GCs with NIT domains was first reported by Moroz et al in 2020 [@Shu2003; @Moroz2020]. It has been proposed that NIT domains in bacteria regulate cellular functions in response to changes in extracellular and intracellular nitrate and/or nitrite concentrations [@camargo2007]. In fact, NO is a free radical molecule, with a half-life of 5 msec in vivo, and is readily converted to nitrate and nitrite [@santos2011; @möller2019; @garthwaite2015a]. And nitrate and nitrite have been reported to accumulate in cells and tissues with high NOS activity in placozoans and cnidarians [@Moroz2004; @Moroz2020]. It is possible that the NIT domains of NIT-GC1 identified in this study may also be used for nitrate/nitrite sensing, as in bacteria. Furthermore, if they show different sensitivities to NO, nitrite and nitrate, it is possible that the temporal variation in their respective half-lives could give rise to a repertoire of activation timings [@lundberg2011]. In addition, we have found at least 15 NIT-GCs in the Platynereis transcriptome data, of which NIT-GC2 is highly expressed in the cPRC, in addition to NIT-GC1. Interestingly, NIT-GC2 showed a very different localisation pattern to NIT-GC1, and furthermore, the results of calcium imaging of cPRC in response to UV stimulation using NIT-GC2 knockdown larvae were the different dynamics (such that hyperpolarisation was suppressed) with NIT-GC1 knockdown. It was not clear from the present analysis whether this difference was due to differences in the localisation or the property of the NIT-GCs. However, the diversification and spatially different localisation patterns of NIT-GCs may increase their signalling repertoire. We also believe that the appearance of NIT-GCs was one of the means to generate the diversity of signalling pathways using NO during the early stages of nervous system evolution in metazoans, since sponges and ctenophores, where NO signalling is present, have no NIT-GCs at all, as many as 12 have been found in placozoans, and NIT-GCs are functional in the "proto-eye" circuit of Platynereis.

## Materials and Methods

**CRISPR-Cas9 Design and Microinjection**

Before designing the small guide RNA (sgRNA) for the sgRNA:Cas9 nuclease, splice sites and polymorphic sites in our laboratory culture were identified to avoid them. The sgRNA targeted the third exon of Platynereis dumerilii NOS (target site: 5'-GGGCAATACTGGCTCCACTC-3'). The sgRNA was assembled from two annealed oligonucleotides (5'-TAGGGCAATACTGGCTCCACTC-3', 5'-AAACGAGTGGAGCCAGTATTGC-3') forming overhangs for cloning into a BsaI site of the plasmid pDR27456 (Hwang et al. 2013)(42250, Addgene), which contains next to the BsaI site a tracrRNA sequence. The plasmid was then used to PCR amplify DNA (primers: T7, 5'-AAAAGCACCGACTCGGTGCC-3') for synthesizing the sgRNA. The DNA was purified with the QIAquick PCR Purification Kit (Qiagen). From the DNA, the sgRNA was synthesized with the MEGAshortscript Kit (Thermo Fisher Scientific) and was purified with the MEGAclear Kit (Thermo Fisher Scientific). Cas9-mRNA was transcribed, capped, and polyA-tailed with the mMessage mMachine Kit and the Poly(A) Tailing Kit (both Thermo Fisher Scientific) from a plasmid (pUC57-T7-RPP2-Cas9) containing the Cas9 ORF fused to 169 base pair 5' UTR from the Platynereis dumerilii 60S acidic ribosomal protein P2. The sgRNA (18 ng/ml) and the Cas9-mRNA (180 ng/µl) were coinjected into fertilized eggs of Platynereis dumerilii wild-type parents according to an established injection procedure [@Conzelmann2013a]. The eggs were kept at 18°C for 45 min before injection and were injected at 14.5°C. The injected individuals were kept at 18°C for 5 to 8 days in 6-well- plates (Nunc multidish no. 150239, Thermo Scientific) and then cultured at 22°C until sexual maturity. The mature worms were crossed to wild-type worms and the progeny was genotyped, resulting in two founder lines, which were bred to homozygosity.

**NOS sequencing and genotyping**

For genotyping of the NOS locus, genomic DNA was isolated from single larvae, groups of 6-20 larvae, or from the tails of adult worms. The DNA was amplified by PCR (primers: 5'-GGTTCATTGGTTTCGATAACATTGCGG-3', 5'-CAGAGTCGATCAGTCTGCATATCTCCA-3') with the dilution protocol of the Phusion Human Specimen Direct PCR Kit (Thermo Scientific). The PCR product was sequenced directly with a nested sequencing primer (5'-GGTGCTCTCCCGGGTACACAA-3'). A mixture of wild-type and deletion alleles in a sample gave double peaks in the sequencing chromatograms, with the relative height of the double peaks reflecting the relative allele ratio in the sample.

**Vertical column setup for pharmacology**

Freely swimming 2-day-old larvae were recorded in 5 adjacent vertical columns (each 31 mm x 10 mm x 144 mm water height) with a DMK 21BF03 camera (The Imaging Source) at 30 frames/s. The columns were illuminated laterally with red (633 nm) light-emitting diodes (LEDs). This light cannot be detected by 2-day-old larvae. The larvae were treated with NOS inhibitors and NO donors. The NOS inhibitors were L-NAME, SMIS, and AGH. The NO donors were SNAP and NONOate. The larvae were treated with different concentrations in adjacent columns. The concentrations for the NOS inhibitors were control, 10 mM, 1 mM, 0.1 mM, and 0.01 mM; for SNAP were control, DMSO control, 1 mM, 0.1 mM, and 0.01 mM; and for NONOate were control 1 mM, 0.1 mM, and 0.01 mM. The larvae were recorded for 30 s then the drugs were added. 30 s, 1 min, 1 h, and 2 h later, the larvae were recorded again for 30 s. The larvae were tracked and their vertical displacement was calculated. Scripts are available at <https://github.com/JekelyLab/NOS>.

**Vertical column setup for measuring photoresponses**

Photoresponses of larvae of different ages were assayed in a vertical Plexiglas column (31 mm x 10 mm x 160 mm water height). The column was illuminated from top with light from a monochromator (Polychrome II, Till Photonics). The monochromator was controlled by AxioVision 4.8.2.0 (Carl Zeiss MicroImaging GmbH) via analog voltage. The light passed a collimator lens (LAG-65.0-53.0-C with MgF2 Coating, CVI Melles Griot) before entering the column. The column was illuminated from both sides with light-emitting diodes (LEDs). The LEDs on each side were grouped into two strips. One strip contained UV (395 nm) LEDs (SMB1W-395, Roithner Lasertechnik) and the other infrared (810 nm) LEDs (SMB1W-810NR-I, Roithner Lasertechnik). The UV LEDs were run at 4 V to stimulate the larvae in the column from the side. The infrared LEDs were run at 8 V (overvoltage) to illuminate the larvae for the camera (DMK 22BUC03, The Imaging Source), which recorded videos at 15 frames per second and was controlled by IC Capture (The Imaging Source).

**NIT-GC Identification and Phylogenetic Analysis**
To identify GPR173 receptors, we obtained a database of vertebrate SREB sequences, including GPR173, GPR85 and GPR27 from (Breton et al. 2021). From these sequences, we produced a Hidden Markov Model (HMM) and used this to mine the 49 species investigated. HMM models were run in HMMR3 with an e-value of 1e−15. The same SREB sequences were used to carry out similarity-based searches using BlastP with an e-value cutoff of 1e−15. We merged these two databases and ran CD-Hit (Fu et al. 2012) to eliminate redundant sequences (at a 99% threshold). To identify the sequences that are closely related to the GPR173 sequences, we ran a cluster-based analysis in CLANS (Frickey and Lupas 2004).The CLANS analysis is available as supplementary fig. S4, Supplementary Material online. To identify clusters, we used the convex-clustering option with 100 jack-knife replicates. The SREB receptors are extremely well conserved and form an easily recognizable cluster. To analyze the phylogeny of SREB receptors, the cluster containing these receptors together with monoaminergic receptors were parsed and used for tree building. We aligned the sequences with MAFFT version 7, with the iterative refinement method E-INS-i. Alignments were trimmed with TrimAl in gappy-out mode (Capella-Gutiérrez et al. 2009). To calculate maximum-likelihood trees, we used IQ-tree2 with the LG+G4 model. To calculate branch support, we ran 1,000 replicates with the aLRT-SH-like and aBayes methods (Minh et al. 2020). The sequences used for the phylogenetic analysis are available in supplementary XX, Supplementary Material online, the trimmed alignment is available in supplementary XX, Supplementary Material online. The raw nexus tree of the SREB receptors is available in supplementary file XX, Supplementary Material online.

**Single-cell analysis**
I used Achim et al 2015 for the single-cell data. In fact, in Liz's 2018 paper, she used 107 cells as neurons by removing duplicates from Achim's single-cell data, so I used those cells.
Since the raw data were read count data, I normalized them to TPM using Python.
After that we converted them to log10. From the sum of the expression levels in 107 cells for each gene, I calculated the percentage in each cell.
I chose the appropriate genes for now. For each cell, I identified them with marker genes.
After created the data in Python, plotted it using R dot plots.

RPKM? TPM?
RPKM calculates the total number of reads per million bp and then divides by the length of each gene, so it is not possible to compare between samples.
Instead, TPM first divides by the length of the gene and then divides by the total number of reads per million bases, which allows for more accurate comparisons between samples.
In this case I wanted to compare between samples, so I used TPM.
In fact, TPM is becoming the mainstream method for many single-cell analyses.
The total TPM of each gene between the samples was used to calculate the percentage of expressed genes.

**Comparing behavior of wildtype and NOS-knockout 3-day-old larvae**

To compare the behavior of wildtype and NOS-knockout larvae at 3 days in the vertical column, the larvae were mixed and left in the dark for 5 min. The larvae were recorded for 1 min in the dark followed by exposure to collimated cyan (480 nm) light from the top of the column for 2 min, then 2 min darkness, and finally collimated UV (395 nm) light from the top of the column for 2 min. Stimulus light was provided by the monochromator (Polychrome II, Till Photonics). Scripts are available at <https://github.com/JekelyLab/NOS>.

**In situ HCR**

Larvae were fixed and treated with Proteinase K, according to the conventional WMISH protocol [@Tessmar-Raible2005], with fixation in 4% paraformaldehyde/ PTW (PBS with 0.05% Tween20) for 2 hr at room temperature, and Proteinase K treatment in 100 µg/ml Proteinase K/ PTW for 3 min [@Tessmar-Raible2005]. Specifically, for the HCR protocol, samples were processed in 1.5 ml tubes. Probe hybridization buffer, probe wash buffer, amplification buffer, and fluorescent HCR hairpins were purchased from Molecular Instruments (Los Angeles, USA). Hairpins associated with the b2 initiator sequence were labeled with Alexa Fluor 647, and the hairpins associated with the b3 initiator sequence were labeled with Alexa Fluor 546. To design probes for HCR, we used custom software [@Kuehn2022] to create 20 DNA oligo probe pairs specific to P. dumerilii NOS, NIT-GC1, NIT-GC2, RYa-pNP (GenBank accession: JF811330.1), c-opsin1 (GenBank accession: AY692353.1), CNGAα (GenBank accession: KM199644.1), and MLD/pedal2-pNP (GenBank accession: KF515945.1). The NOS, NIT-GC1 and NIT-GC2 probes were designed to be associated with the b2 initiator sequence, while the RYa-pNP, c-opsin1, CNGAα and MLD/pedal2-pNP probes were designed to be associated with the b3 initiator sequence. For the detection stage, samples were pre-hybridized in 200 µl of probe hybridization buffer for 1 hr at 37°C, and then incubated in 250 µl hybridization buffer containing probe oligos (4 pmol/ml) overnight at 37°C. To remove excess probe, samples were washed 4× with 1 ml hybridization wash buffer for 15 min at 37°C, and subsequently 2× in 1 ml 5× SSCT (5× SSC with 0.1% Tween20) for 5 min at room temperature. For the amplification stage, samples were pre-incubated with 100 µl of amplification buffer for 30 min, room temperature, and then incubated with 150 µl amplification buffer containing fluorescently labeled hairpins (40nM concentration (2ul of 3uM stock in 150ul amplification buffer, snap-cooled as described; [@Choi2018]) overnight in the dark at 25°C. To remove excess hairpins, samples were washed in 1 ml 5× SSCT at room temperature, twice for 5 min, twice for 30 min, and once for 5 min. During the first 30 min wash, samples were counterstained with DAPI (Cat. #40043, Biotium, USA).

**Immunohistochemistry**

Whole-mount immunostaining of 2 day old Platynereis larvae fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde were carried out using primary antibodies raised against NIT-GC1, NIT-GC2, NOS, RYamide neuropeptide, RGWamide neuropeptide in rabbit, plus a commercial antibody raised against acetylated tubulin in mouse (Sigma T7451). The synthetic peptides contained an N-terminal Cys that was used for coupling during purification. Antibodies were affinity purified from sera as previously described [@Conzelmann2012]. Immunostainings were carried out as previously described [@Conzelmann2012].

**Calcium imaging**

For calcium imaging, 49--55 hpf larvae were used. Experiments were performed at room temperature and larvae were immobilised by being embedded in 2.5% agarose filtered artificial seawater between a slide and coverslip spaced with adhesive tape. GCaMP6s mRNA (1 mg/ml) was injected into zygotes as described previously (Randel et al., 2014). Larvae were imaged on a Zeiss LSM 880 with Airyscan (with a C-Apochromat 63X/1.2 Corr - water) with a frame rate of 1.88 frame/sec and an image size of 512 x 512 pixels. The larvae were stimulated in a region of interest (a circle with ?? pixel diameter) with 405 nm lasers controlled by the Bleaching mode. The imaging laser had a similar intensity than the stimulus laser but covered an area that was ?? times larger than the stimulus ROI.

**Cell culture experiment**

Green cGull was used for the cGMP assay [@Matsuda2017]. A full-length Pdum-NIT-GC1 and -NIT-GC2 coding sequences were amplified by PCR starting from a Platynereis dumerilii cDNA library and cloned into the pcDNA3.1(+) vector using the T2A self-cleaving sequence. Cos-7 cells with low expression of endogenous soluble guanylate cyclase were used as cultured cells for gene expression. This cell line was purchased from Angio-proteomie (CAT no. cAP-0203). The Cos-7 cells were maintained at 37 °C in 35mm dishes (Nunc™ Glass Bottom Dishes) containing 3 mL of DMEM, high glucose glutamax medium (Thermo; Cat. No. 10566016) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (Thermo; Cat. No. 10082147). Upon reaching confluency of approximately 85%, we transfected the cells with the plasmid containing Green cGull-T2A-NITGC1. Transfections were carried out with 150 ng of each plasmid and 0.3 μl of the transfection Lipofectamine 3000 Reagent (invitrogen; Cat. No. ???). Two days post-transfection, we removed the culture medium and substituted it for fresh DMEM-medium. For single-wavelength imaging experiments, cells in 35-mm dishes were washed twice and imaged in modified Ringer's buffer (140 mM NaCl, 3.5 mM KCl, 0.5mM NaH2PO4 , 0.5mM S-3 MgSO4 , 1.5 mM CaCl2 , 10 mM HEPES, 2 mM NaHCO3 and 5 mM glucose). Dishes were mounted on a stage heated at 37 °C and imaging was performed using an inverted microscope (LSM880, Zeiss) equipped with an oil-immersion objective lens (UApo/340, 40, NA = xx). Images were acquired using a xenon lamp, 460--495 nm excitation filter, 505-nm dichroic mirror and 510-- 550-nm emission filter (????). 8-br-cGMP and S-Nitroso-N-acetyl-D, L-penicillamine (SNAP) were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich (St. Louis, MO, USA) and Cayman Chemical (Ann Arbor, MI, USA). The exposure time of the EM-CCD camera was controlled by the ZEN software (Zeiss). Images were acquired every 15 s for 10 min and stimulation was initiated 2 min after starting image acquisition. Imaging data analysis was performed using ImageJ (National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD, USA).

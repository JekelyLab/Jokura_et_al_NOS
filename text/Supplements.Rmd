![**Figure 1---figure supplement 1.** Phylogenetic tree of NOS by maximum likelihood. Tree robustness was tested with 1000 replicates of ultrafast bootstrap with the aLRT-SH-like and aBayes methods.](../figures/Fig1_sup1.png){width="100%"}

![**Figure 1---figure supplement 2.** Expression analysis of the NOS gene (magenta) using in situ HCR using the larva at 3-day-old in dorsal view (A) and anterior view (B). (B) Insert: showing two NOS cells on each side.](../figures/Fig1_sup2.png){width="100%"}

![**Figure 3---figure supplement 1.** Expression analysis of the NOS gene (magenta) using in situ HCR using the larva at 3-day-old in dorsal view (A) and anterior view (B). (B) Insert: showing two NOS cells on each side.(F) The temporal changes in the distance traveled of the WT and mutant larvae before and after UV stimulation are shown.(E and F) After UV stimulation is indicated by purple.](../figures/Fig3_sup1.png){width="100%"}

![**Figure 4---figure supplement 1.** Phylogenetic tree of guanylate cyclase by maximum likelihood (ML). Guanylate cyclase-coupled receptor and soluble guanylate cyclases (sGC) as outgroups. Guanylate cyclases with NIT domains are found in most animal phyla except Porifera, Ctenophora, Urochordata and Chordata.](../figures/Fig4_sup1.png){width="100%"}

![**Figure 4---figure supplement 2.** (A) Immunostaining with NOS antibodies. (B) Co-expression analysis image with the RYamide proneuropeptide gene (RYa-pNP: green), which is highly expressed in INNOS. White arrowheads indicate co-expressed INNOS. Black arrowheads indicate larval eyes. White dashed lines indicate the outer frame of the larva. (A) Co-expression analysis image of the MLD-pedal2 amide proneuropeptide gene (MLD-pNP: green). Black arrowheads indicate cells different from cPRC. (B) Co-localisation analysis using NIT-GC1 and NOS antibodies.](../figures/Fig4_sup2.png){width="100%"}

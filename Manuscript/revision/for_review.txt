for review:

Hi Gaspar, just a random feedback about Kei's paper - I noticed there is no mention in the Methods sections about the actual culture of Platynereis, ie where wildtype larvae were sourced from. You may want to include at least a brief mention of that (and perhaps mention facility managers/animal technicians in the Acknowledgements section).
